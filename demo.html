    <p class="p">I was born in South Carolina in 1989. I moved to Pennsylvania when I was a few years old and that's where I grew up. Since then I have lived in a lot of parts of the country including Florida, California and Texas. </p>

    <p class="p">My work background consists of time in the Marines as an avionics technician, a cable technician for Time Warner Cable, a security officer and finally a human resources technician. Of all of those jobs I most enjoyed being a human resources technician but only because I got to work as a civilian with the Marines and Navy. It was like being back in the Marines but without all of the terrible parts!</p>

    <p class="p">I wanted to get into software development as it is such a growing industry. I was living in Austin, Texas and seeing my friends in the tech industry loving their careers. I realized it was time to make the jump and here I am! I am looking forward to learning with all of you over the next months.</p>
